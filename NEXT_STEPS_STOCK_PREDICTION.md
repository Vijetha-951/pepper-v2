# Stock Demand Prediction - Next Steps

## ✅ What's Been Done

I've implemented a complete **Stock Demand Prediction** feature for your admin dashboard. Here's what was added:

### Backend (Decision Tree Algorithm)
- ✅ `backend/src/services/demandPredictionService.js` - Core prediction algorithm
- ✅ 3 new API endpoints in `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.js`

### Frontend (Dashboard Widget)
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/DemandPredictionWidget.jsx` - Interactive widget
- ✅ Integration into `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

### Documentation
- ✅ `STOCK_DEMAND_PREDICTION_GUIDE.md` - Complete feature guide
- ✅ `QUICK_START_STOCK_PREDICTION.md` - 5-minute setup guide
- ✅ `TESTING_STOCK_PREDICTIONS.md` - Testing scenarios
- ✅ Other reference documents

### Step 1: Start the Application (2 minutes)

**Open Terminal 1:**
```bash
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\PEPPER\backend

```

**Open Terminal 2:**
```bash
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\PEPPER\frontend
npm start
```

**Wait for:** Browser opens to http://localhost:3000 (or manually go there)

---

### Step 2: Test the Feature (2 minutes)

1. **Click on any product card** to expand and see:
   - Detailed prediction reasoning
   - Last 3 months sales history
   - Recommended stock adjustment

2. **Click Refresh button** to reload latest predictions

3. **Review the summary cards** to understand:
   - Critical Stocks (⚠️ red alert items)
   - Need Increase (📈 rising demand)
   - Can Reduce (📉 declining demand)
   - Total Analyzed (📦 all products)

---

### Step 4: Use the Predictions (Ongoing)

## 📊 What You're Looking At

### Decision Tree in Action

**Example Product: Karimunda**
```
Current Stock: 8 units
Last 3 months: 10, 12, 15 units (average 12.3)
Overall average: 8.5 units

Decision:
✓ Has sales history
✓ Has recent sales  
✓ Trend is RISING (15 > 8.5 × 1.2)
✓ Stock is LOW (8 < 12.3)

Result: INCREASE +30% → Suggest 24 units
Confidence: 85%
```

### The 4 Recommendation Types

| Recommendation | What It Means | Color | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| INCREASE | Rising demand, stock too low | 🟢 Green | Order more |
| REDUCE | Declining demand | 🔴 Red | Order less |
| MAINTAIN | Stable demand | 🟡 Yellow | Keep as is |
| MONITOR | New product, need data | 🔵 Blue | Watch & wait |

## 🔧 Customization (If Needed)

### Change Seasonal Months
Edit `backend/src/services/demandPredictionService.js`:
```javascript
// For Climber peppers, adjust these months:
'Climber': [3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11]

// For Bush peppers:
'Bush': [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### Adjust Decision Thresholds
Same file, look for these values and adjust:
- Rising trend trigger: `1.2` (20% increase)
- Declining trigger: `0.8` (20% decrease)  
- Stock turnover: `0.3` (30%)
- Critical stock: `5` units
- Adjustment percentages: `30%`, `20%`, `15%`, `10%`

### Change Analysis Window
Same file, change this line:
```javascript
static async generatePredictions(monthsBack = 6)  // Change 6 to desired months
```

## ✅ Verification

### Is It Working?

**Check these:**
1. ✅ Backend running? (http://localhost:5000/api/health returns `{"status":"ok"}`)
2. ✅ Frontend accessible? (http://localhost:3000 loads without errors)
3. ✅ Can log in as admin? (Dashboard page loads)
4. ✅ Widget visible? (Scroll to bottom of dashboard)
5. ✅ Products show? (Top 5 list not empty)

**If any fail:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Check backend terminal for error messages
- Verify MongoDB is running
- Try `npm start` again in appropriate folder

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Widget not showing"
→ Make sure you're logged in as **admin** (not regular user)

### "No products listed"
→ Database needs sales data. Create some test orders first.

### "API call failed"
→ Backend might not be running. Check terminal window.

### "Refresh not working"
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:

- [ ] Widget appears on admin dashboard
- [ ] 4 summary cards show numbers (not zeros)
- [ ] At least 1 product shows in top 5 list
- [ ] Click Refresh button works
- [ ] Can expand/collapse product details
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Color badges are showing
