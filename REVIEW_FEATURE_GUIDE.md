## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. **Review Model** (`backend/src/models/Review.js`)
```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId,              // Reference to User
  product: ObjectId,           // Reference to Product
  order: ObjectId,             // Reference to Order (for verification)
  rating: Number,              // 1-5 stars
  comment: String,             // User's review text (max 1000 chars)
  complaintType: String,       // 'None' | 'Damaged' | 'Wrong Variety' | 'Delayed Delivery' | 'Other'
  complaintDescription: String, // Complaint details (max 1000 chars)
  isPublished: Boolean,        // Show on product page
  productSnapshot: Object,     // Product data at time of review
  editCount: Number,           // Track how many times edited
  lastEditedAt: Date,          // When last edited
  createdAt: Date,             // Auto-tracked
  updatedAt: Date              // Auto-tracked
