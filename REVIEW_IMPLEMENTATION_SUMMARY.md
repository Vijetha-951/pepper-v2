  user: ObjectId (ref: User),           // Who wrote it
  product: ObjectId (ref: Product),     // Which product
  order: ObjectId (ref: Order),         // Which order (for verification)
  
  // Review content
  rating: Number,                       // 1-5
  comment: String,                      // Max 1000 chars

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### User Ownership
- Users can only edit/delete their own reviews
- Backend verifies: `review.user === currentUser._id`

### Order Verification
- Can only review if user owns the order
- Order must have status = "DELIVERED"
- Product must be in the order items

### Data Validation
- Rating: Must be integer 1-5
- Comment: Max 1000 characters
- Complaint types: Enum validation
- No duplicate reviews per product per user

### Time-Based Restrictions
- Edit/Delete window: 30 days from creation
- Frontend: Buttons disappear, status shows "Cannot edit"
- Backend: Rejects edit/delete requests > 30 days

---

## 📊 Review Statistics

When fetching public product reviews:
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "totalReviews": 42,
    "averageRating": "4.7",
    "ratingBreakdown": {
      "5": 35,
      "4": 5,
      "3": 2,
      "2": 0,
