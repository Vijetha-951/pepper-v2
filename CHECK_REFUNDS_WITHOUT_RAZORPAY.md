# 🔍 Check Refunds WITHOUT Razorpay Login

**Perfect for when you don't have Razorpay credentials!**

This guide shows you how to verify refunds using only your application and database.

---

## ✅ **Method 1: User Dashboard (Easiest)**

### For End Users:

1. **Login to your application**
2. **Go to "My Orders" page**
3. **Look for cancelled orders**

### What You'll See:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Order #12345                            │
│ Status: CANCELLED                       │
│         ✓ Refunded  ← Refund processed! │
│                                         │
│ Refund ID: rfnd_abc123xyz  ← Green     │
│ Amount: ₹1,500                          │
│ Date: 15 Jan 2024                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**If you see:**
- ✅ **Green "Refund ID" badge** → Refund was initiated
- ✅ **"✓ Refunded" badge** → Payment status is REFUNDED
- ❌ **No refund badges** → Either COD order or refund failed

## ✅ **Method 4: Direct MongoDB Query**

### Using MongoDB Shell:

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongo

# Switch to your database
use pepper_db

# Find all refunded orders
db.orders.find({ "payment.refundId": { $exists: true } })

# Find specific order
db.orders.findOne({ _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011") })

# Count refunds by status
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { "payment.refundId": { $exists: true } } },
  { $group: { _id: "$payment.refundStatus", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

# Get total refunded amount
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { "payment.refundId": { $exists: true } } },
  { $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: "$payment.refundAmount" } } }
])
```

### Using MongoDB Compass (GUI):

1. **Open MongoDB Compass**
2. **Connect to**: `mongodb://localhost:27017/pepper_db`
3. **Select**: `orders` collection
4. **Filter**:
   ```json
   { "payment.refundId": { "$exists": true } }
   ```
5. **View**: All refunded orders with details

## 📊 **Understanding Refund Status**

### Database Field: `payment.refundStatus`

| Status | Meaning | What It Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **PENDING** | Refund initiated | Razorpay is processing the refund |
| **PROCESSED** | Refund completed | Razorpay sent money to bank |
| **FAILED** | Refund failed | Something went wrong, needs manual intervention |

### Timeline:

```
PENDING (Day 0-2)
   ↓
PROCESSED (Day 2-3)
   ↓
Money in Customer Account (Day 5-7)
```

---

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### ✅ Successful Refund:

```javascript
{
  payment: {
    status: "REFUNDED",           // ✅ Payment status changed
    refundId: "rfnd_xyz789",      // ✅ Razorpay refund ID exists
    refundAmount: 1500,           // ✅ Amount matches order total
    refundStatus: "PROCESSED",    // ✅ Razorpay processed it
    refundInitiatedAt: "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"  // ✅ Timestamp exists
  }
}
```

### ❌ No Refund (COD Order):

```javascript
{
  payment: {
    method: "COD",                // COD orders don't get refunds
    status: "PENDING",
    // No refund fields
  }
}
```

### ⚠️ Failed Refund:

```javascript
{
  payment: {
    status: "PAID",               // ⚠️ Still PAID, not REFUNDED
    refundId: "rfnd_xyz789",      // Refund was attempted
    refundStatus: "FAILED",       // ⚠️ Failed status
    // OR no refundId at all
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: "No refund information found"

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **COD Order**: Cash on delivery orders don't need refunds
2. **Payment Not Completed**: Order was cancelled before payment
3. **Refund Failed**: Check backend logs for errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check order details
node backend/src/scripts/checkOrderRefund.js <order_id>

# Check backend logs
# Look for "Refund failed" or "Razorpay error" messages
```

---

### Issue: "Refund status is PENDING for too long"

**Check:**
1. How many days since refund initiated?
2. Is it more than 7 business days?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check exact status
node backend/src/scripts/checkOrderRefund.js <order_id>

# If > 7 days, you may need to:
# 1. Check Razorpay dashboard (if you get access)
# 2. Contact Razorpay support with refund ID
# 3. Process manual refund from Razorpay dashboard
```

---

### Issue: "Customer says money not received"

**Verify:**
1. ✅ Refund status is PROCESSED in database
2. ✅ 5-7 business days have passed
3. ✅ Customer checking correct bank account

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Verify refund status
node backend/src/scripts/checkOrderRefund.js <order_id>

# 2. Check days since refund
# Script will show: "Days since refund initiated: X days"

# 3. If PROCESSED and > 7 days:
#    - Ask customer to check bank statement
#    - Look for "RAZORPAY" or your business name
#    - May take up to 10 business days in rare cases
```

2. Go to Transactions → Refunds
3. Search by Refund ID (from your database)
4. Share screenshot or status with you

## 🎯 **Quick Reference Commands**

```bash
# Check specific order refund
node backend/src/scripts/checkOrderRefund.js <order_id>

# List all recent refunds

## 📋 **Refund Verification Checklist**

Use this checklist to verify a refund:

- [ ] Order status is CANCELLED
- [ ] Payment method is ONLINE (not COD)
- [ ] Payment status changed from PAID to REFUNDED
- [ ] `payment.refundId` exists (starts with `rfnd_`)
- [ ] `payment.refundAmount` matches order total
- [ ] `payment.refundStatus` is PROCESSED (not PENDING or FAILED)
- [ ] `payment.refundInitiatedAt` has a timestamp
- [ ] Less than 7 business days have passed (if customer waiting)
- [ ] Refund ID visible in user dashboard (green badge)
- [ ] "✓ Refunded" badge showing in UI

---

## 🎓 **Example Workflow**

### Scenario: Customer asks "Where is my refund?"

**Step 1: Get Order ID**
```
Customer provides order number or you search by email
```

**Step 2: Check Database**
```bash
node backend/src/scripts/checkOrderRefund.js 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
```

**Step 3: Interpret Results**

**If PROCESSED:**
```
✅ "Refund was processed on [date]"
✅ "Money will reach your account in 5-7 business days"
✅ "It's been X days, please wait Y more days"
```

**If PENDING:**
```
⏳ "Refund is being processed by Razorpay"
⏳ "This can take 5-7 business days"
⏳ "We'll notify you once completed"
```

**If FAILED or No Refund:**
```
⚠️ "There was an issue processing your refund"
⚠️ "We'll process it manually and update you"
⚠️ "Please contact support with Order ID: #12345"
```
