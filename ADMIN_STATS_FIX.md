# Admin Dashboard Stats Fix

## Problem Fixed
The admin dashboard overview page was showing only the admin's personal order statistics instead of system-wide statistics for all orders.

## Root Cause
- The Dashboard component was calling `/orders/stats` endpoint for all users (regular users and admins)
- The `/orders/stats` endpoint filters results by the logged-in user's ID
- This meant admins only saw their own orders, not all orders in the system

## Solution Implemented
Created an admin-specific stats endpoint with smart role detection in the frontend.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Backend: Added Admin Stats Endpoint
**File**: `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.js`

Added new endpoint `GET /api/admin/stats` that returns comprehensive system-wide statistics:

```javascript
router.get('/stats', asyncHandler(async (_req, res) => {
  // Returns:
  // - totalOrders: Count of all orders in system
  // - pendingDeliveries: Orders not yet delivered or cancelled
  // - totalProducts: Count of available products
  // - statusStats: Breakdown of orders by status (PENDING, APPROVED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, etc.)
  // - revenue: Total revenue, average order value, and count of completed orders
  // - todayOrders: Orders created today
  // - todayRevenue: Revenue from today
  // - recentActivity: Last 5 orders from all users with user information
}))
```

**Key Features**:
- Counts ALL orders in the system (not filtered by user)
- Provides revenue breakdown for delivered orders only
- Shows order status breakdown
- Includes recent activity from all users
- Provides today's metrics

#### 2. Frontend: Added Admin Stats Service Method
**File**: `frontend/src/services/customerProductService.js`

Added `ADMIN_URL` constant:
```javascript
const ADMIN_URL = '/api/admin';
```

Added new method `getAdminDashboardStats()`:
- Fetches from `/api/admin/stats` endpoint
- Returns system-wide statistics for admin users

#### 3. Frontend: Smart Role Detection
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

Updated `fetchDashboardStats()` function to:
- Check if user role is 'admin'
- Call `getAdminDashboardStats()` for admin users
- Call `getDashboardStats()` for regular users
- Both return the same data structure for consistency

```javascript
const data = user.role === 'admin' 
  ? await customerProductService.getAdminDashboardStats()
  : await customerProductService.getDashboardStats();
```

## Data Returned by Admin Stats Endpoint

```json
{
  "totalOrders": 45,                    // Total orders in system
  "pendingDeliveries": 12,              // Orders awaiting delivery
  "totalProducts": 21,                  // Available products
  "newNotifications": 0,                // Placeholder for notifications
  "statusStats": {
    "PENDING": 5,
    "APPROVED": 7,
    "OUT_FOR_DELIVERY": 3,
    "DELIVERED": 28,
    "CANCELLED": 2
  },
  "revenue": {
    "totalRevenue": 15000,              // Revenue from delivered orders
    "averageOrderValue": 535.71,        // Average value per delivered order
    "completedOrders": 28               // Number of delivered orders
  },
  "todayOrders": 2,                     // Orders created today
  "todayRevenue": 350,                  // Revenue from today's delivered orders
  "recentActivity": [                   // Last 5 orders from all users
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "type": "order",
      "status": "DELIVERED",
      "user": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      },
      "items": [...],
      "totalAmount": 450,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
    // ... more orders
  ]
}
```

## How to Verify

### 1. Test Admin Dashboard
1. Login as an admin user
2. Navigate to Dashboard > Overview tab
3. Verify that stats show:
   - All orders in the system (not just admin's orders)
   - Correct pending deliveries count
   - Revenue statistics
   - Today's metrics
   - Recent activity from all users with customer names

### 2. Test Regular User Dashboard
1. Login as a regular customer user
2. Navigate to Dashboard > Overview tab
3. Verify that stats show only their personal data:
   - Their total orders
   - Their pending deliveries
   - Their recent orders

### 3. API Testing
Test the endpoints directly:

```bash
# Admin stats (only for admin users)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/admin/stats

# Regular user stats
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-token>" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/orders/stats
```

## Files Modified
1. `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.js` - Added `/stats` endpoint
2. `frontend/src/services/customerProductService.js` - Added `ADMIN_URL` constant and `getAdminDashboardStats()` method
3. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated `fetchDashboardStats()` to use role-based routing

## Backward Compatibility
- Regular users continue to use `/orders/stats` endpoint (no changes)
- Admin endpoint is new and doesn't affect existing functionality
- Dashboard component automatically uses correct endpoint based on role

## Next Steps
- Monitor admin dashboard to ensure all metrics are accurate
- Consider adding more detailed analytics (e.g., revenue by date range, customer segmentation)
- Consider adding admin notifications/alerts based on critical metrics
