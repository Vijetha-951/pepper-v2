# Admin Role Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
There was a mismatch in admin email configurations between different parts of the system:

- **Frontend (.env)**: `REACT_APP_ADMIN_EMAIL=vijethajinu01@gmail.com`
- **Backend (auth.js)**: Hardcoded admin email was `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com`
- **Firebase**: Had conflicting role assignments

This caused confusion where:
- `vijethajinu01@gmail.com` was showing as admin in dashboard
- `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` was showing as user

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Frontend Environment Configuration
✅ **Updated**: `c:\xampp\htdocs\PEPPER\frontend\.env`
```
REACT_APP_ADMIN_EMAIL=vj.vijetha01@gmail.com  # Changed from vijethajinu01@gmail.com
```

### 2. Firebase Role Corrections
✅ **Executed**: `forceCorrectAdminRoles.js` script
- Set `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` as admin in Firestore
- Set `vijethajinu01@gmail.com` as user in Firestore
- Updated Firebase custom claims for both accounts
- Blocked unauthorized admin access attempts

### 3. System Consistency Verification
✅ **Confirmed**:
- Backend auth.js: `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` (hardcoded admin)
- Frontend .env: `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` (environment variable)
- Firebase Firestore: `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` (role: admin)
- Firebase Claims: Properly set for both accounts

## Current State

| Email | Role | Dashboard Access | Firebase Claims |
|-------|------|------------------|-----------------|
| `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` | admin | ADMIN DASHBOARD | `{role: 'admin', isAdmin: true}` |
| `vijethajinu01@gmail.com` | user | USER DASHBOARD | `{role: 'user', isAdmin: false, blocked: true}` |

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Clear Cache First
- Open `c:\xampp\htdocs\PEPPER\clear-admin-cache.html`
- Click "Clear All Cache & Data"
- Close all browser tabs

### 2. Test Admin Access
1. Login with `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com`
2. ✅ Should see ADMIN dashboard with full admin features

### 3. Test User Access  
1. Login with `vijethajinu01@gmail.com`
2. ✅ Should see USER dashboard (no admin features)

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **Frontend**: Uses `REACT_APP_ADMIN_EMAIL` for UI logic
2. **Backend**: `auth.js` middleware hardcodes `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` as admin
3. **Firebase**: Stores role in Firestore and custom claims
4. **Security**: Non-admin emails are blocked from admin role even if Firestore says admin

### Files Modified
- `frontend/.env` - Updated admin email
- Firebase Firestore users collection - Role corrections
- Firebase Auth custom claims - Properly assigned

### Scripts Used
- `backend/scripts/forceCorrectAdminRoles.js` - Fixed role assignments
- `backend/verify-admin-fix.js` - Verified the fix

## Security Notes
- ✅ Only `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` can have admin access
- ✅ Backend middleware blocks unauthorized admin attempts
- ✅ `vijethajinu01@gmail.com` is permanently blocked from admin role
- ✅ All system components are now consistent

## Next Steps
The admin role issue is completely resolved. The system now correctly:
- Recognizes `vj.vijetha01@gmail.com` as the only admin
- Treats `vijethajinu01@gmail.com` as a regular user
- Prevents unauthorized admin access attempts
- Maintains consistency across all system components
