## Important Notes

### Email Sending is Non-Blocking
- If email fails, payment/order still succeeds
- Errors are logged but don't affect user experience
- This ensures reliability

### Email Configuration is Optional
- App works without email configuration
- Users just won't receive email notifications
- All other functionality remains intact

### Security
- Email credentials stored in .env (not committed to git)
- Using App Passwords (not regular passwords)
- Secure SMTP connection
