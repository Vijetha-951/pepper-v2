  STOCK DEMAND PREDICTION FEATURE - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

📊 FEATURE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Stock Demand Prediction system uses a Decision Tree algorithm to analyze
historical sales data and automatically generate stock recommendations for
your PEPPER admin dashboard.

Example Decision Flow:
  If month = June and past sales trend = rising, then increase stock by 20%
  If sales declining and stock turnover < 30%, then reduce stock by 20%
  If stock ≤ 5 units, then recommend immediate restock

🎯 KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

✅ Decision Tree Algorithm
   - Analyzes last 6 months of sales history
   - Calculates trend direction (Rising/Declining/Stable)
   - Detects seasonal patterns (Climber/Bush types)
   - Generates urgency scores (0-100)
   - Calculates confidence percentages

✅ Four Recommendation Types
   - INCREASE (green) → Rising demand, low stock
   - REDUCE (red) → Declining demand, poor turnover
   - MAINTAIN (yellow) → Stable demand
   - MONITOR (blue) → New product, insufficient data

✅ Real-Time Dashboard Widget
   - 4 Summary cards with key metrics
   - Trend distribution visualization
   - Top 5 priority products ranked by urgency
   - Expandable details with sales history
   - One-click refresh button

✅ Robust API Endpoints
   - Dashboard summary endpoint
   - Top predictions endpoint
   - Individual product endpoint
   - All with admin authentication
   - Configurable parameters

✅ Production-Ready Implementation
   - Full error handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - No breaking changes
   - Backward compatible
   - Security validated

================================================================================
📊 WHAT YOU'LL SEE
================================================================================

Summary Cards (4 Cards):
  🔴 Critical Stocks: Number of products with ≤5 units
  🟢 Need Increase: Products with rising demand
  🟡 Can Reduce: Products with declining demand
  🔵 Total Analyzed: All active products tracked

Trend Distribution (3 Metrics):
  ↑ Rising: Products with increasing sales
  → Stable: Products with steady sales
  ↓ Declining: Products with decreasing sales

Top 5 Priority Products:
  • Ranked by urgency score
  • Shows product name and type
  • Current stock and recent sales average
  • Recommendation with color badge
  • Confidence percentage
  • Stock adjustment (current → suggested + %)
  • Click to see sales history and reasoning

================================================================================
🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE ALGORITHM
================================================================================

Decision Tree Logic:

1. CHECK SALES HISTORY
   No history? → MONITOR (new product)
   No recent sales? → REDUCE (no demand)
   Has history? → Continue

2. ANALYZE TREND
   Rising? 
     → If stock too low → INCREASE (20-30%)
     → Else → MONITOR
   
   Declining?
     → If poor turnover → REDUCE (20%)
     → Else → MAINTAIN
   
   Stable?
     → If seasonal month → INCREASE (15%)
     → If critical stock → INCREASE (10%)
     → Else → MAINTAIN

Example:
  Product: Karimunda
  Current Stock: 8 units
  Sales: Last 3 months = 10, 12, 15 units
  
  Analysis:
  • Trend: RISING (15 > 8.5 × 1.2)
  • Stock: INSUFFICIENT (8 < 12.3)
  • Recent avg: 12.3 vs Overall avg: 8.5
  
  Recommendation: INCREASE +30%
  Suggested Stock: 24 units
  Confidence: 85%

================================================================================
