  ```

### 3. Dependencies

#### `backend/package.json`

## How It Works

### Online Payment Flow (Razorpay)
1. User completes payment on Razorpay
2. Payment verification succeeds
3. Order is created in database
4. **Email is sent** with payment success details
5. Frontend shows success message
6. User is redirected to orders page

### COD Payment Flow
1. User selects Cash on Delivery
2. Order is created in database
3. **Email is sent** with order confirmation
4. Frontend shows success message
5. User is redirected to orders page

## Email Templates

### Payment Success Email
```
Subject: ✅ Payment Successful - Order Confirmed

Content:
- Greeting with user name
- Order ID and Payment ID
- Order date and time
- Table of ordered items (product, quantity, price, total)
- Total amount paid
- Shipping address
- What's next information
- Professional footer
```

### Order Confirmation Email (COD)
```
Subject: ✅ Order Confirmed - Cash on Delivery

Content:
- Greeting with user name
- Order ID
- Order date and time
- Table of ordered items
- Total amount (to be paid on delivery)
- Delivery address
- Payment reminder
- Professional footer
```

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup (Gmail)

1. **Install Dependencies** (Already done):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install nodemailer
   ```

2. **Generate Gmail App Password**:
   - Enable 2-Step Verification: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Generate App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Update .env File**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password
   ```

4. **Restart Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**:
   - Check console for: `✅ Email service initialized`
   - Make a test payment
   - Check email inbox

### Detailed Setup
See `backend/EMAIL_SETUP.md` for complete instructions including:
- Other email services (Outlook, Yahoo, Custom SMTP)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security best practices
- Production recommendations

## Testing

### Test Payment Success Email
1. Add products to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Select "Online Payment"
4. Use Razorpay test card:
   - Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   - CVV: Any 3 digits
   - Expiry: Any future date
5. Complete payment
6. Check email inbox for payment success email

### Test COD Order Email
1. Add products to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Select "Cash on Delivery"
4. Place order
5. Check email inbox for order confirmation email

## Error Handling

### Email Sending Failures
- **Behavior**: Order/payment still succeeds even if email fails
- **Logging**: Errors are logged to console
- **User Impact**: None - user still sees success message and order is created

### Missing Email Configuration
- **Behavior**: System logs warning but continues to work
- **Console Message**: `⚠️ Email service not configured`
- **User Impact**: No emails sent, but all other functionality works

## Security Considerations

1. ✅ **App Passwords**: Using Gmail App Passwords instead of regular passwords
2. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Email credentials stored in .env (not committed)
3. ✅ **Non-blocking**: Email failures don't affect payment processing
4. ✅ **Validation**: Email addresses validated before sending
5. ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with logging

## Frontend (Already Implemented)

### Success Message Display
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Checkout.jsx`
- **Line**: 317 (approximately)
- **Code**:
  ```javascript
  setSuccess('Payment successful! Order has been placed.');
  setTimeout(() => {
    navigate('/orders');
  }, 2000);
  ```

### Success Message UI
- **Style**: Green background with success icon
- **Duration**: 2 seconds
- **Action**: Auto-redirect to orders page
