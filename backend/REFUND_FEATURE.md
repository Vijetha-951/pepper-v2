# Razorpay Automatic Refund Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically processes refunds through Razorpay when users cancel their orders from the My Orders page in the user dashboard.

## How It Works

### 1. Order Cancellation Flow
When a user clicks "Cancel" on an order:
1. **Custom Modal** appears asking for confirmation
2. User confirms cancellation
3. **Backend processes**:
   - Validates order can be cancelled (PENDING or APPROVED status only)
   - Restores product stock automatically
   - **Initiates Razorpay refund** (for ONLINE payments)
   - Updates order status to CANCELLED
   - Updates payment status to REFUNDED
4. **Frontend displays** success message with refund information

### 2. Refund Processing Logic

#### Eligible for Automatic Refund:
- ‚úÖ Payment method: **ONLINE** (Razorpay)
- ‚úÖ Payment status: **PAID**
- ‚úÖ Order status: **PENDING** or **APPROVED**
- ‚úÖ Valid transaction ID exists

#### Not Eligible for Automatic Refund:
- ‚ùå Payment method: **COD** (Cash on Delivery - no refund needed)
- ‚ùå Payment status: Not PAID
- ‚ùå Order status: DELIVERED, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, or already CANCELLED

### 3. Refund Timeline
- **Initiation**: Immediate (when order is cancelled)
- **Processing**: Handled by Razorpay
- **Credit to Account**: **5-7 business days** (standard Razorpay timeline)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. Refund Service (`src/services/refundService.js`)
```javascript
// Main functions:
- processRefund(paymentId, amount, reason)
- checkRefundStatus(refundId)
- processOrderRefund(order)
```

**Features:**
- Razorpay API integration
- Error handling for common scenarios
- Refund status tracking
- Amount conversion (rupees ‚Üî paise)

#### 2. Updated Order Model (`src/models/Order.js`)
New payment fields added:
```javascript
payment: {
  method: String,
  status: String,
  transactionId: String,
  refundId: String,           // NEW
  refundAmount: Number,       // NEW
  refundStatus: String,       // NEW: PENDING, PROCESSED, FAILED
  refundInitiatedAt: Date     // NEW
}
```

#### 3. Updated Cancel Order Endpoint (`src/routes/user.routes.js`)
- Route: `DELETE /api/user/orders/:id`
- Authentication: Required (requireCustomer middleware)
- Authorization: Users can only cancel their own orders

**Process:**
1. Validate order ownership
2. Check order status (PENDING/APPROVED only)
3. Restore product stock
4. **Process refund** (if ONLINE payment)
5. Update order status to CANCELLED
6. Return success message with refund details

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Orders Page (`src/pages/Orders.jsx`)
**Updates:**
- Displays refund ID in order table
- Shows "‚úì Refunded" badge for refunded orders
- Success message includes refund information

#### 2. Styling (`src/pages/Orders.css`)
**New styles:**
- `.refund-id` - Green badge showing refund ID
- `.refund-status-badge` - "‚úì Refunded" indicator

## API Response Examples

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: User must be logged in
2. **Authorization**: Users can only cancel their own orders
3. **Validation**: Order status checked before cancellation
4. **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate refunds
5. **Signature Verification**: All Razorpay responses verified

## Future Enhancements

1. **Partial Refunds**: Allow refunding specific items
2. **Refund Reasons**: Capture why user cancelled
3. **Email Notifications**: Send refund confirmation emails
4. **Refund History**: Dedicated refund tracking page
5. **Instant Refunds**: Use Razorpay's instant refund feature (requires approval)
6. **Webhook Integration**: Real-time refund status updates from Razorpay

## Support

### For Users:
- Refund timeline: 5-7 business days
- Contact support if refund not received after 7 days
- Provide Order ID and Refund ID for faster resolution

### For Developers:
- Check backend logs for refund processing errors
- Verify Razorpay credentials in .env
- Test in Razorpay test mode before production
- Monitor Razorpay dashboard for refund status

## Important Notes

1. **Stock Restoration**: Always happens, even if refund fails
2. **Order Status**: Always updated to CANCELLED
3. **Refund Failure**: Order still cancelled, manual refund required
4. **COD Orders**: No refund processing needed
5. **Razorpay Limits**: Check your account limits for refunds
6. **Test Mode**: Use test credentials for development
7. **Production**: Switch to live credentials for production
