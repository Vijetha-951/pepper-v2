# 📦 Delivery Boy Orders Dashboard - Feature Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

The delivery boy dashboard now allows delivery boys to:
1. **View all assigned orders** on their dashboard
2. **Accept orders** with a single click
3. **See order status** at a glance with color-coded badges
4. **View order details** including items, delivery address, and amount

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **Live Orders Dashboard**
- Fetches assigned orders from the backend API
- Real-time stats showing:
  - Number of **Assigned** orders (pending acceptance)
  - Number of **Accepted** orders
  - Number of **Out for Delivery** orders

### 2. **Order Cards**
Each order card displays:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Order #ABC123                                        │
│ • Product Name                                       │
│ • Location: Address, District                        │
│ • Amount: ₹1,500                                     │
│ • Status: [ASSIGNED] [Accept Button]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. **Accept Order Button**
- Green button with loading animation
- Only appears for **ASSIGNED** status orders
- Updates order status to **ACCEPTED**
- Automatically refreshes the orders list after accepting

### 4. **Status Badges**
Color-coded badges show order status:
- 🟨 **ASSIGNED** (Yellow) - Waiting for delivery boy to accept
- 🟩 **ACCEPTED** (Green) - Order accepted, ready to deliver
- 🟦 **OUT_FOR_DELIVERY** (Blue) - Currently being delivered
- 🟩 **DELIVERED** (Light Green) - Successfully delivered
