## 📊 Data Validation

Review submissions are validated for:
- ✅ User owns the order
- ✅ Order status is DELIVERED
- ✅ No duplicate reviews per product
- ✅ Rating is 1-5
- ✅ Comment max 1000 chars
- ✅ Edit/delete only within 30 days

All validation happens on both frontend AND backend for security.

---

## 🔒 30-Day Edit/Delete Window

| Time | Status | Can Edit | Can Delete |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Day 0-30 | Editable | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Day 31+ | Locked | ❌ No | ❌ No |

Buttons disappear after 30 days. Status changes to:
"Cannot edit (30 days passed)"

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Review button doesn't appear
- ❌ Order status must be "DELIVERED"
- Check order status in Orders table
- Wait for delivery to complete

### Can't submit review - "Duplicate review"
- You already reviewed this product
- Click Edit to modify instead
- Or delete first, then resubmit

### Edit/Delete buttons missing
- 30-day window has expired
- This is by design (immutable after 30 days)
- System prevents accidental changes to old reviews

### Modal won't open
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Refresh page
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

---

## 📱 Mobile Support

All components are fully responsive:
- ✅ Desktop: Full grid layout
- ✅ Tablet: 2-column grid
- ✅ Mobile: Single column, large touch targets

---

1. Show reviews on product pages

5. Display helpful voting
